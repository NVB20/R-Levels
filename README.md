# CandleSniper ðŸ”«ðŸ“ˆ

**CandleSniper** is a Pine Script project designed for TradingView that allows traders to visually plan trades based on any candle of their choice. By selecting a specific candle using its `bar_index`, the script automatically draws the following levels on the chart:

- **Entry**: High of the candle + 0.01
- **Stop Loss**: Low of the candle - 0.01
- **3R Target**: Entry + (Candle Range Ã— 3)
- **6R Target**: Entry + (Candle Range Ã— 6)

This is a great tool for **manual backtesting**, **risk-reward visualization**, and **strategy refinement**.
